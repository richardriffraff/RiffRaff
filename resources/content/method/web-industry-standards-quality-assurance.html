<h1>Industry Standards &amp; Quality Assurance</h1> 
<p>Building for the modern web can be a minefield. With so many devices and web browsers around, crafting an online experience that looks and works perfectly no matter what you're using can be extremely challenging. Given that new techniques and design patterns are popping up all the time, it's difficult to know if you're getting the real deal or not, until things start falling apart.</p>
<p>At Riff Raff, we understand that patience and diligence pay dividends in the long run. A properly designed and crafted website will stand the test of time, and retain its integrity no matter how you use it, whether you're on a desktop computer or the latest touchscreen mobile such as the iPhone. All of our work is built to the very latest open standards, to ensure that it 
will continue to behave as expected as new browsers and devices hit the market.</p> 
<p>We understand that quality runs far deeper than the design your customer sees, and so we have devised our own development handbook; a set of minimum standards that all of our developers strive to surpass in every project we undertake. This handbook outlines a strict benchmark in security, performance and scalability that all of our work must exceed, and around which our framework itself evolves.</p>
