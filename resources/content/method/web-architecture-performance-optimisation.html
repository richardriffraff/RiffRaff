<h1>Technical Architecture, Performance &amp; Optimisation</h1>
<p>All of our projects are built on our proprietary MVC framework, which allows us to work quickly and efficiently. Our library of code and modular architecture allow us to accelerate those dull and repetitive setup tasks, freeing us to spend our time developing innovative and creative experiences for your customers.</p> 
<p>We specialise in large scale, high-volume websites and applications that need to perform quickly and predictably under pressure, coping with enormous volumes of traffic. We employ our wide range of expertise to achieve this, from meticulous planning and architecture to tried and tested caching and database optimisation techniques. Every project is benchmarked for speed, both front-end and back, to ensure that your site is rock solid and responsive.</p>	
<p>If you're concerned about the integrity of your web project, why not drop by for chat. Any one of our personable <small class="strike">geeks</small> developers will be more than happy to explain how they manage to squeeze so much performance out of every line of code.</p>


<h2>What is a Framework?</h2>
<p>A framework is a library of structured programming code that gives us a basic foundation on which to build great software. This minimises the cost of getting started on a project, and increases the amount of time we can spend developing a quantifiable return on your investment.</p>
<p>Most web development agencies use free off-the-shelf CMS or E-Commerce solutions, but this approach has its drawbacks. The website or application they build is often severely limited by the solution they use, compromising the project's potential to generate revenue, and ultimately leading to poor return.</p> 
<p>We take a more pragmatic approach. We believe that your CMS or E-Commerce platform should be designed around the optimum user experience, not the other way around. Our framework allows us to build an effective, tailored solution quickly, and without compromise, to the specification you're paying for.</p>
