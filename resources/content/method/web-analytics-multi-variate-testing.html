<h1>Analytics &amp; Multi-Variate Testing</h1> 
<p>There's only one way to truly understand how people are using your website: Analytics. There are lots of solutions available, to track a user from the moment they enter your website, to the moment they leave, giving you a better understanding of who they are, where they've come from, and what they're looking for. Using analytics effectively, you can begin to refine your 
design, user experience and content offering to meet their needs.</p> 
<p>Once your website is setup for tracking and analysis, we can really begin to experiment with your users. Multi-variate testing is a process through which we can refine your website design, in terms of interactivity, layout and aesthetics. Using this methodically, we can continuously refine and improve your website until we reach an optimum conversion rate.</p>
<p>With even moderate traffic, the smallest increase in conversion can have a dramatic effect on the amount of revenue your website potentially generates. This technique is particularly important when it comes to deploying Pay Per Click campaigns, where your cost of acquisition can be substantial, and the number of conversions has a direct impact on your bottom line.</p>

<h2>Split Testing Explained</h2> 
<p>Multi-Variate or Split-Testing involves designing two or more versions of the same page, and dividing incoming traffic equally between them, send half your visitors to one, and half to the other. This is usually carried out on a page of some significance to your customer, such as a product page on your e-commerce website, which contains a clear call to action. The conversion rates of each design are tracked and analysed over time, determining which is the most effective design.</p>
