<h1>User Testing &amp; Feedback</h1> 
<p>A design is rarely perfect first time. It happens, but not very often. This isn't down to poor design, but because design is such a subjective field. What appeals to one person won't appeal to another. There are always subtle details that are under-estimated, or decisions made based on assumptions that turn out to be a little fuzzy. The only way to identify and correct 
them is through user testing.</p> 
<p>User Testing involves trialing your website or application on real users in real scenarios. It helps us to identify strengths and weaknesses in the design and functionality that you probably didn't know were there. Using this information, we can fine-tune your website to increase engagement and revenue. There are many ways to conduct User Testing, from expensive laser eye-tracking studies to simple one-on-one interview techniques. Both of these methods are perfectly valid, and will deliver extremely interesting (and sometimes surprising) results. A few simple changes to your design could make all the difference to conversion and user engagement.</p>
<p>At Riff Raff, we prefer to test little and often, keeping it simple and inexpensive. Over the years, we've found that you can gather a surprising amount of useful feedback from only a handful of test subjects, in a relatively short period of time. And because it's not costing a huge amount of your budget, it pays for itself over and over in the long run.</p> 
<p>Why not give us a call on +44(0)191 233 1153, or pop in for a coffee to find out how we create genuinely successful websites and applications based on real user feedback.</p>


<h2>A Good Investment</h2>
<p>The trouble with testing is that it doesn't come for free, and most people want to see every penny they spend on the front-end of their website, earning money. A large outlay at the beginning of a project on expensive eye-tracking studies can drain valuable development budget, which makes it difficult to justify</p>
<p>But testing can deliver huge benefits, stripping down unforeseen barriers for your end users, increasing satisfaction with your service and boosting conversion. Testing doesn't have to be expensive, and should be an integral part of the overall design process.</p>
