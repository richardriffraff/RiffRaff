<h1>Page: Brand &amp; Creative Design</h1>
<p>When the design is right, it's the polish that makes your website shine, giving your business a quality and authority that makes you stand out. It's the icing on the cake, and the bit everyone is looking forward to seeing. Careful treatment of your brand, through effective use of typography and colour bring all of our deft engineering to life, and can make or break your customers' first impressions.</p> 
<p>Successful aesthetic design is subtle and complex; a meticulous balance between beauty and utility. Designing for the web involves the usual synthesis of visual hierarchy and structure found in more traditional graphic design, with the added dimensions of interactivity and motion.</p> 
<p>Why not pop in for a chat to find out more; our designers are more than happy to take you through some of our work and explain the logical rationale behind their design decisions.</p>

<h2>Solid Foundations</h2> 
<p>Our designers are traditionally trained, with a solid foundation in typography, colour theory, layout and composition. Combined with our understanding of the technology behind our creations, we strike the perfect balance between form and function, whether we're working within your existing brand guidelines, or creating entirely new ones.</p>
