<h1>Website &amp; Application Development</h1>
<p>With a thoroughly considered specification and a  world class design, we can begin to build your website. Our team of web developers are dedicated, creative fanatics; seasoned specialists in solving complicated problems in simple, elegant ways. We operate on DRY principles, reducing wasted effort at every point in the development process to run projects smoothly and efficiently.</p> 
<p>Our MVC framework enables us to develop quickly, and prepares us for all that prickly stuff that makes most web developers break out in a cold sweat: multiple language support, multiple server support, security, analytics, caching and performance.</p> 
<p>Rather than using an off-the-shelf CMS like most web development agencies do, we employ our huge handcrafted library of code to create tailored solutions that deliver far beyond your expectations. And because we're not slave to anyone else's software, we can give you exactly what you want. And then some.</p>
<p>All of our code is managed using the latest Distributed Version Control systems, enabling us to work both remotely and in large development teams, without running the risk of data loss. This also provides us with an accurate audit trail, to track down and fix issues without fuss. We can even collaborate with in-house and third party web development teams, reducing the risk of conflict.</p> 
<p>If you're interested in how we build our websites and applications, or have any concerns over the integrity and security of the data we use, please give us a call on +44(0)191 233 1153 to find out more.</p>


<h2>What is a Framework</h2>
<p>A framework is a library of structured programming code that gives us a basic foundation on which to build great software. This minimises the cost of getting started on a project, and increases the amount of time we can spend developing a quantifiable return on your investment.</p>
<p>We take a more pragmatic approach. We believe that your CMS or E-Commerce platform should be designed around the optimum user experience, not the other way around. Our framework allows us to build an effective, tailored solution quickly, and without compromise, to the specification you're paying for.</p>
