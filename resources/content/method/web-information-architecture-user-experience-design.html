<h1>Information Architecture &amp; User-Experience Design</h1> 
<p>The key to creating engaging web experiences is planning out your content so that the right messages reach the right customers at the right time. Every user wants something different from their experience, and by catering to their individual needs we can create an environment that empowers them in a way that cannot be achieved with off-the-shelf solutions.</p>
	
<p>User experience design identifies your users and their needs by type, attempting to design an environment that makes each of them feel comfortable, engaged and satisfied. User experience design is about creating a "state of optimum flow"; seamlessly guiding your customer from where they are, to where you want them to be.</p>

<h2>Context is everything</h2> 
<p>Think about how you would buy a car: What you will buy, and what kinds of messages you will respond to depends on who you are, and what you need. Whether you're a trendy young entrepreneur, an economically minded school-run mum, or an environmentally conscious city commuter, your needs and emotional touch-points will be very different. You're still looking to buy a car, but your desires and expectations of the product (and your experience of buying it) will be poles apart.</p>
