<h1>User Interface Development</p> 
<p>All of our websites and applications are built using open standards, and we make a conscious effort to employ the latest technologies in order to drive our industry forward. Proprietary platforms such as Flash and Flex are reserved for situations when we need something extra special that simply cannot be achieved with a standards-based approach.</p> 
<p>Not only do web standards ensure more predictable compatibility across numerous computer and mobile platforms, but they also ensure that your website will continue to look and function as intended well into the future, as new devices and web browsers evolve. Standards-compliant code also means lighter, faster web pages that will boost performance, not only for your users, but for search engines too.</p>
