<h1>Accessibility &amp; DDA Compliance</h1> 
<p>It is our legal and ethical responsibility to make sure that your website is available to as wide an audience as possible, including those with disabilities. Compliance with DDA recommendations and regulations can be challenging, especially when it comes to video and audio content.</p> 
<p>There are various levels of compliance, each more challenging than the last. To which level we optimise your website depends on your audience and their access requirements. For instance, a public sector service used by a broad cross-section of society will need to cater for as many types and levels of disability as possible, whilst a more specialist service aimed at a particular market segment may not need to be so all-encompassing. We can help you identify the DDA criteria your website needs to meet, and design your website to be accessible to your audience, whoever they happen to be.</p>
