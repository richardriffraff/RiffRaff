<h1>Deployment, Hosting &amp; Support</h1> 
<p>Traffic-intensive websites need to be well maintained to keep them in tip-top shape. Our MVC framework is extremely fast and doesn't need a fancy or expensive server setup - a standard Linux web server is fine - and can be deployed anywhere from an inexpensive shared host to a full-on dedicated server.</p>
<p>We can take care of everything for you; Installation, setup and ongoing maintenance. Whether you'd like to use a preferred hosting provider, or allow us to manage the entire process for you, we can work in whatever way makes you feel comfortable. We're more than happy to offer impartial advice, too.</p> 
<p>Some of our bigger clients require round-the-clock monitoring and service to keep their websites running smoothly during peak traffic periods, often out of office hours across distant parts of the World. Your website may not need that kind of service, in which case we can offer inexpensive hosting on our own shared servers.</p> 
<p>If you're unsure what your requirements are, give us a call on +44(0)191 233 1153 for free, impartial advice.</p>
