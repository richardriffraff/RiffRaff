<h1>Page: Usability &amp; Interaction Design</h1> 
<p>Once we've defined who your customers are, and what they want from your website, we begin to think about how we're going deliver it. Interaction Design is the art of creating engaging interfaces that react and respond to your customers' behaviour so seamlessly and intuitively, that they will be putty in your hands.</p> 
<p>Specialising in large-scale website design, we've come to understand a lot about how users interact with our work, whether that's through a keyboard, mouse or fingertip gestures. Anything that a user touches or modifies has the potential to create frustration and confusion, so we gain a user's confidence by carefully designing each component to be predictable and responsive.</p>
<p>A precisely designed and executed user interface can have have an enormous psychological impact on your customers, making your site feel faster and more responsive. High quality, effective interaction design is extremely rare, and is one of our core specialities.</p>

<h2>Reassurance is Key</h2> 
<p>Interaction Design is not only about beautiful layout, and sumptuous buttons; Delicate use of animation can reinforce your customers' experience of the web, providing visual clues as to subtle or hidden features that they might have otherwise overlooked. With a little care and attention to detail, even the most understated motion can bring an interface to life, and guide the user's eye without them even knowing it.</p>
