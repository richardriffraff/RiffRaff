<h1>Bespoke Content Management Systems</h1>
<p>We've developed <em>a lot</em> of bespoke content management systems, at all levels. From single-user management of a  brochure website, to multi-lingual corporate solutions supporting teams of administrators all over the world. No matter how big or small, the same rules apply. An effective, properly designed content management system will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>be usable by those with no training in HTML or CSS (and hackable by those who have)</li> 
	<li>be accessible from any computer or web browser, from anywhere, and at any time</li> 
	<li>be intuitive and easy to learn</li> 
	<li>be secure, robust and predictable</li>  
	<li>support multiple administrators with varying read-write permissions</li>  
	<li>should not impose new workflows on existing infrastructures</li>  
	<li>should not constrain the front-end user experience through lack of flexibility or functionality</li>  
</ul>
<p>Off-the-shelf CMS solutions used by most web design companies often constrain the customer-facing website, damaging the user experience and limiting the potential of the site to provide a return. By tailoring the content management system to the needs of the user, rather than the other way around, we provide all the administrative control you need, without limiting what is possible on your website.</p>
