<h1>Page: Social &amp; Community Portals</h1> 
<p>Social networking and online communities have come a long way since the news groups and discussion forums of old. Discussion still plays a pivotal role in a successful online community, but the mechanisms through which we conduct these conversations are far more numerous and exciting than ever before.</p>
<p>For some businesses, initiating and maintaining a meaningful dialogue with their customers is vital for survival, whilst for others it is the key to the domination of their market. But how do you go about starting these conversations? We have a wealth of experience designing and developing community-driven websites, from integrating social components with pre-existing applications, to building entire social and community portals from the ground up.</p>
<p>We have had the privilege of watching our online communities grow and evolve, and have learned a great deal about how people interact with one another online, how we can provide the tools to facilitate those relationships, and how we can leverage that engagement to generate revenue for your business.</p>
<p>Give us a call on +44(0)191 233 1153 to find out how you can leverage social interaction to increase revenue on your website. Alternatively, take a look at our <a href="../web-design-development-method.html" title="View: RiffRaff's Step by Step development Process">step-by-step development process</a> to find out how we design and develop rich, engaging social experiences.</p>


<h2>To build or integrate?</h2>
<p>Identifying which tools you need, and whether to build from scratch or to integrate with the the myriad third party services available can be difficult for even the most hardened marketing guru. Mash-ups can be great for prototyping, but can often result in a disjointed user experience that does more damage than good.</p> 
<p>We can help you assess which tools are most suitable to both your customers' needs and your business objectives, and whether to invest your budget into the integration of existing tools, or inventing entirely new ones.</p>
