<h1>Website Design &amp; Development</h1>
<p>We've worked on a lot of big, complicated projects. We build robust, secure, lightening fast websites day-in, day-out. But we love smaller websites too. They're often the most fun and rewarding projects to work on, usually commissioned by people like you; passionate entrepreneurs who are looking for an exceptional web presence to leave their competitors eating dust.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of working on large-scale web projects is the huge amount of code, knowledge and experience we've built up in the process. Our smaller projects benefit from these advantages right from the start, ready to scale up when your business evolves. </p>
<p>All of our websites are built with search engine optimisation in mind, with excellent structure, lightweight footprint and keyword-rich URL's as standard. We always work with the very latest web standards, and can support a broad array of web browsers, desktop and mobile devices with our comprehensive testing suite.</p> 
<p>Our design process can be as comprehensive or as simple as you like. We're happy to provide the whole service end-to-end, or give you a pick n' mix based on how much your timescale and budget will allow. Take a look at our <a href="../web-design-development-method.html" title="View: RiffRaff's Step by Step development Process">step-by-step development process</a> to find out how we design and develop beautiful websites that will knock your competitor's socks off.</p>
