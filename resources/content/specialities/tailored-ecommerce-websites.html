<h1>Tailored E-Commerce Solutions </h1>
<p>Most e-commerce websites generate revenue at only a fraction of their potential. Off-the-shelf E-commerce solutions really haven't evolved much over the last decade, and most transactional websites are still based on a hierarchical catalogue of products with a shopping basket.</p> 
<p>For some markets, such as FMCG, where finding and comparing products represents the entire shopping experience from beginning to end, this model works extremely well. But it expects the customer to know exactly what they're looking for, and to understand all of the options on offer.</p> 
<p>This isn't unreasonable when you're selling music CD's or Blu-ray discs, but when it comes to selling something more complicated, such as a digital camera, bicycle or sports equipment, the buying process becomes a little more convoluted.  Filtering and comparison tools are useful, but they assume knowledge and familiarity that the customer doesn't necessarily posses.</p> 
<p>And this is what the current generation of e-commerce websites don't do; empower the customer to make the right decision. The level of help a customer needs to enable them to make a good decision depends on their experience, their budget level and their individual needs.</p> 
<p>By identifying key customer types, we can begin to define core messages and user-journeys that they are most likely to respond to. We can create user experiences that guide them from a state of confusion to a position of confidence. The more tailored your user experience is to your individual customer's needs and context, the more likely they are to buy from you.</p>
<p>At Riff Raff, we understand the customer's decision making process, from the instinctual emotional hit, to the rational search for supporting detail. Combined with our understanding of how users interact with website technology, your knowledge of your own customers and competitors provides the perfect foundation on which to build an e-commerce website that will drive your business forward.</p>
