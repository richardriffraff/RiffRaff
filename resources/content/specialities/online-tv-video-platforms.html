<h1>Online TV &amp; Video Platforms</h1>
<p>Whether you are a brand owner or content distributor, setting up a profitable online TV platform can seem like an enormous challenge. Video is king when it comes to content, with an immediacy and emotional impact unmatched by traditional content, and with the proliferation of affordable video streaming services and video-enabled devices, there's never been a better time to get in on the action.</p> 
<p>Designing and engineering scalable online TV platforms has become something of a speciality for Riff Raff; from 
inexpensive API mash-ups powered by free video services such as Vimeo and YouTube, to full-scale bespoke TV platforms for global brands. We've covered the whole gamut, from supporting complex back-end administration and editorial workflows, to performance optimisation to cope with the enormous amounts of traffic these sites generate.</p>
<h2>Delivering your video content</h2>
<p>We can help you identify potential revenue streams in order to monetise your video content, whether your strategy is about driving sales or generating traffic. We can provide the tools you need to make the most of affiliate partnerships, advertising networks and even direct integration with e-commerce systems.</p> 
<h2>Building your audience</h2>
<p>We can help you define a social integration strategy that will maximise your audience reach through viral distribution and content syndication. Through thoughtful integration with the most popular social networking platforms, we can help you grow your audience, and engage them with high definition video content.</p>
<h2>Video content management workflows</h2>
<p>Once you're up and running, managing and administrating an online TV platform is a serious challenge. This 
administrational workflow extends beyond simply uploading and organising your video content. Consumers like to have their video content filtered for the best possible experience, and that requires editorial control; the ongoing curation of channels and content that keeps your customers coming back for more. And this requires some specialists tools.</p> 
<p>We design and develop extremely powerful template management systems that allow content editors to create and manage editorialised video content and landing pages. These templates can be assembled ahead of time, and scheduled to go live at a future time and date, giving ultimate editorial control. With a layered permissions system and sign-off procedures built-in, we can create a bespoke Content Management solution to fit your existing production workflow.</p>
