<h1>Quality Assurance</h1>
<p>We specialise in large, complex web solutions, which brings with it a number of unique challenges. With so many moving parts, it can be difficult to ensure that everything is functioning as it should be, and operating at its full potential. The integrity of our work is extremely important to us, so we build quality assurance right into our project management workflow, with rigorous testing and assessment at each stage of the development process.</p>
<p>Each member of our development team is responsible for the integrity of their work, running their own tests before deploying to a staging environment for assessment by a supervisor. We believe that any work we accept payment for should be in full working order and fit for purpose, we do not charge for bug-fixing, or restrict our customers with a time-limited warranty.</p>
