<h1>Analytics, Testing &amp; Refinement</h1> 
<p>Our commercially-orientated design philosophy means that we stand by the integrity of our work, and strive to ensure that everything we deliver earns you a return on your investment that exceeds expectations. Audiences are notoriously fickle and can be quite unpredictable, so our approach to creating successful experiences on the web has to be based on fact.</p> 
<p>Truly effective design is an iterative process. It's never absolutely perfect first time, and there is always room for improvement. Using Analytics systems, we can track your users as they engage with your website, and learn from their actions. We can accurately gauge how they respond to different designs, content and messaging, using this data to refine and optimise your website over time.</p> 
<p>By methodically testing, observing and learning about user behaviour on your website, we make iterative adjustments and measure the response. This way, all permanent design changes are based on solid evidence, maximising your website's potential to generate revenue.</p>
