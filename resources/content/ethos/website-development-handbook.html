<h1>Riff Raff Development Handbook</h1> 
<p>The quality of our work is extremely important to us, not only in terms of pixel-perfect rendition, but also in terms of the security and integrity of our code. A typical Riff Raff web project revolves around a huge amount of traffic and user activity, handling complex data and monetary transactions that need to be robust and secure.</p>
<p>Due diligence is paramount to our planning and architectural procedures, to ensure that our own exacting standards are met before a project is deployed to the public domain. This benchmarking is used to assess a number of criteria, including security, stability and performance.</p>
<p>In order to protect the integrity of our work, and our reputation as a company, we have compiled our own development handbook. This handbook outlines a strict benchmark in security, performance and scalability that all of our work must exceed, and around which our framework itself evolves. It acts as a mantra to our developers, and a guiding light to new members of the team.</p>
